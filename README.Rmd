## 1. Introduction

The user authentication in Shiny applications can be very useful. Mainly, user can 
login to read and write some results of their session into relational database.

This package contains modules to use in your Shiny application allowing you to 
automatically insert boxes for login, register and password reset procedure. At 
this point of development it supports only user database contained within
googlesheet document in you googledrive account, so it requires usage of
googlesheet4 package.

Currently the package is minimal working prototype. In the future I plan to widen the usability:

1. more localizations for user database locations than googlesheet
2. customizations of database (fe: authorisation levels)
3. widen the requirements for user ID and password


## 2. Installation

You can install this version of shiny.reglog from GitHub with:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StatisMike/shiny.reglog")
```

## 3. Setup

To use the contents of this package, you need to take some steps outside of R.

1. Create a valid googlesheet in your googledrive storage space.

    Created googlesheet should consists of at least two sheets, as this version of shiny.reglog uses them (though the googlesheet can contain as many extra sheets as you want). The required sheets need to be as follows:

  * user_db sheet with four columns, named: timestamp, user_id, user_mail and user_pass
  
    ![user_db sheet](img/user_db.png)
  
  * reset_db sheet with three columns, named: timestamp, user_id, reset_code

    ![reset_db sheet](img/reset_db.png)

  * During that step you can also copy the ID of your spreadsheet. It will be needed for login_server() module, and you can get it from the URL of spreadsheet. ID is the character string in the blurred portion on the image below:
  
    ![spreadsheet ID](img/ss_id.png)

2. Configure googlesheets4 package to use out-of-band auth. For more information about it visit [googlesheets4 documentation](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/)

## 4. Information about functions

All functions generates text (input labels, descriptions, authomatic e-mail). You can control the language of displayed text with 'lang' argument. Currently it supports English (the default) and Polish (lang = "pl"). If you want to use non-default language, you need to set the 'lang' argument consistently between all functions of the package.

### 4.1. UI functions

All UI functions creates a div() element which can be input into UI of your application, inside a fluidRow(), complete fluidPage(), tabItem() of dashboard or any other container of your choosing.

#### 4.1.1. register_UI()

The register box contains inputs for User ID (which can be used to link the user with other elements in external databases), E-mail address (which will be used to send confirmation e-mail and reset codes for your password) and for password and password repetition. It tests validity of all inputs and tries to register new account after pushing the "Register" button.

It produces modal dialog detailing the result. Additionally, if registered successfully it sends user a confirmation e-mail.

Currently the functions accept user ID and password consisting of 8~20 alphanumeric characters. It is planned to change in future iterations to widen the requirements - especially for passwords.

Provided password is saved in hashed form - using the scrypt::hashPassword() function.

#### 4.1.2. login_UI()

The login box contains inputs for user ID and password. After pushing the "Login" button, it check validity of inputs and logins user. Produces modal dialog detailing results.

![login](img/login_form.png)

#### 4.1.3. password_reset_UI()

The box for password reset consists of two UI elements: the password_reset_UI div() element and modal dialog it produces after confirming validity of inputted confirmation code.

The main div() contains input for User ID. After user inputs their ID, they should push "Send code" button, which generates their 24h-valid resetcode mails it to their e-mail and stores in hashed form in the database.

After they receive reset code, they need to input it in the next inputbox below and push next button. The validity of inputted code in relation to user ID is then checked. If correct, the new modal dialog opens to input the new password.

![password reset UI](img/resetpass_form.png)

The user need to provide new password and repeat it to check for any typos. After pushing the "Confirm new password" button, below input boxes a message is rendered to give feedback to the user - if the password was changed successfully. After that, the user can close modal dialog with "OK" button.

### 4.2. Server function

Currently there is only one server function: login_server()

```{r login_server, eval = FALSE}
login_server(id = "login_system", 
             gsheet_file, 
             gmail_user,
             gmail_password,
             appname,
             appaddress,
             lang = "eng")
```

#### 4.2.1. Arguments

+ *id* argument defaults to "login_system". You can use different name, but keep it consistent for all functions
+ *gsheet_file* is the character string containing your googlesheets ID. Its location is described in Setup section of this document
+ *gmail_user* is the character string of your gmail address that you wish the application to use for automatic e-mails
+ *gmail_password* is the character string of your gmail account password
+ *appname* is the character string with title of your application
+ *appaddress* is the character string with URL address of your application for your users to navigate from their confirmation mail
+ *lang* argument defaults to "eng". It changes the language of your modules. Currently only one other option is available: "pl" for Polish.

#### 4.2.2. Value

login_server() function creates reactiveValues object containing three dataframes.

+ *active_user* after log-in contains logged user row from the database, consisting of *timestamp* (the date of account creation/password reset), *user_id* (the character string of user ID), *user_mail* (the character string of user e-mail address), *user_pass* (the character string of hashed user password). If the user is not logged in, the *active_user* value is "not_logged"
+ *user_db* contains the whole user database loaded from googlesheets file - filtered for one row for every user_id (only the most recently created row)
+ *reset_db* contains the whole reset_db loaded from googlesheets - filtered as above

You can use it's output mainly to access the active_user data

```{r active_user example, eval = FALSE}
# save the output in the server function of you application

reactive_db <- login_server()

# to access user ID you can use

reactive_db$active_user$user_id

# though remember to check if the active_user value isn't "user_logged"

```



## 5. Example

This is the code for ShinyApp presented in images above.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(shiny.reglog)

UI <- dashboardPage(
  header = dashboardHeader(title = "Test for login modules"),
  sidebar = dashboardSidebar(
    sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Login", tabName = "login"),
    menuItem("Reset password", tabName = "resetpass"),
    menuItem("Register", tabName = "register"))
  ),
  body = dashboardBody(
    tabItems(
      tabItem("login",
              fluidPage(login_UI())),
      tabItem("resetpass",
              fluidPage(password_reset_UI())),
      tabItem("register",
              fluidPage(register_UI()))
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  
  googlesheets4::gs4_auth(email = "yourgdrive@gmail.com",
                          path = "your_json.json",
                          cache = "your/location/for/.secrets/",
                          use_oob = TRUE)
  
  reactive_db <- login_server(gsheet_file = "your_googlesheets_ID", 
                              gmail_user = "yourgmail@gmail.com",
                              gmail_password = "yourgmail",
                              appname = "Name of your application",
                              appaddress = "address_of_your.app.io")
  
}

shinyApp(ui = UI,
         server = server)


```
