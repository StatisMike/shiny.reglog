## 1. Introduction

The user authentication in Shiny applications can be very useful. Mainly, user can 
login to read and write some results of their session into relational database.

On the other hand, it may be handy for your App to allow access of unregistered
users. If you need to secure your ShinyApp, there are better alternatives
([shinymanager](https://github.com/datastorm-open/shinymanager){target="_blank"} or 
[shinyauthr](https://github.com/PaulC91/shinyauthr){target="_blank"})

This package contains modules to use in your Shiny application allowing you to 
automatically insert boxes for login, register, credentials edit and password 
reset and procedures.

*shiny.reglog* supports as data containers either databases accessed with
`RSQLite`, `RMariaDB`, `RMySQL` and `RPostgreSQL` drivers or googlesheets-based
database (accessed by `googlesheets4` package).

It is highly recommended to use one of the `DBI`-supported databases, though. It
is much more optimized and secure, as the database is never loaded as a whole
into the memory, but queried as needed. *googlesheets* database is much easier to
set-up, but it shouldn't be used when you are expecting big userbase.

Registration, credentials edit and password reset procedures programmatically 
send email to the user of your ShinyApp - to welcome them, inform about change
of their user ID and/or email and to give them a reset code to reset their 
password. *shiny.reglog* supports two methods of email sending: via `emayili`
or `gmailr` packages. Both of them have their pros and cons, depending on your
accesses: `emayili` allows for usage of many SMTP servers, while `gmailr` allowing
using *gmail* messaging via Google REST API. 

The `emayili` is recommended for most applications. `gmailr` can be useful
if you already have application registered and authorized with mail sending
scope.

Currently the package is after major change in its code - basically full rewrite
to allow more security, usage of more databases and more customization. Past 
functions are still available in current version, but will 
generate deprecation warnings. 

## 2. Basic structure 

There are three main objects that are to be used when implementing *RegLog* system
for login and registration in your ShinyApp. All of them need to be defined
in the *server* code.

- *dbConnector*: one of `RegLogDBIConnector` or `RegLogGsheetConnector`. It will handle
all writes, edits and inputs to the users database.
- *mailConnector*: one of `RegLogEmayiliConnector` or `RegLogGmailrConnector`. It
will handle all automatical emailing to the user emails.
- *RegLogServer*: The main module producing and controlling all of UI and 
reactivity of the login and registration system. It uses *dbConnector* and
*mailConnector* for actions external of R.

## 3. Installation

You can install this version of shiny.reglog from GitHub with:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# install version 0.5.0 from GitHub 
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StatisMike/shiny.reglog")

# or install old version from CRAN
# install.packages("shiny.reglog")
```

## 4. Setup

To set-up the database for *RegLog* system, you can use helper functions
included in this package. They are tested and guarantee compatible structure
of the data.

### 4.1 Googlesheet database method

1. Create googlesheet file on your googledrive to support database. You can use
`gsheet_tables_create()` function, which by default creates empty spreadsheets
configured correctly.

```{r creating gsheet, eval = F}
# create googlesheet and gather its id for later usage
# you can also specify optional 'name' argument for custom gsheet name

gsheet_id <- gsheet_tables_create()

# save you gsheet_id - you need to provide it later to your dbConnector
```

If you wish to import some existing credentials, you can do it by giving the 
`data.frame` object to the `user_data` argument:

```{r, eval = F}
# get some credentials
credentials <- data.frame(
  username = "ShinyReglogTest",
  password = "VeryHardPassword",
  email = "shinyreglog@test"
  )

# create gsheet database with some credentials
gsheet_id <- gsheet_tables_create(
  user_data = credentials,
  # as the password was not hashed with `script` before, it need to be
  # hashed now
  hash_passwords = T)

```

2. Configure googlesheets4 package to use out-of-band (non-interactive) auth. For more information about it visit [googlesheets4 documentation](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/).

### 4.2 `DBI` compatible SQL database

*RegLog system* out of the box supports *SQLite*, *MySQL*, *MariaDB* and *PostgreSQL*
databases. You can use `DBI_tables_create` function, which by default creates empty 
tables configured correctly.

```{r creating SQLite, eval = F}
# create a connection to the database. Remember to use user with CREATE TABLE
# scope enabled when useing MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL connection

conn <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = "reglog_db.sqlite"
)

# using this connection create the tables.
DBI_tables_create(conn = conn)

# disconnect from the database after creation
DBI::dbDisconnect(conn)
```

If you wish to import some credentials, you can do it by providing the `data.frame` 
object to the `user_data` argument:

```{r, eval = F}
# get some credentials
credentials <- data.frame(
  username = "ShinyReglogTest",
  password = "VeryHardPassword",
  email = "shinyreglog@test")

conn <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = "reglog_db.sqlite"
)

# create database using the connection
DBI_tables_create(conn = conn,
                  user_data = credentials)

DBI::dbDisconnect(conn)
```

## 4. Information about functions

All functions generates text (input labels, descriptions, authomatic e-mail). You can control the language of displayed text with `lang` argument. Currently it supports English (the default) and Polish (`lang = "pl"`). If you want to use non-default language, you need to set the 'lang' argument consistently between all functions of the package.

### 4.1. UI functions

All UI functions creates a `div` element which can be input into UI of your application, inside a `fluidRow`, complete `fluidPage`, `tabItem` of dashboard or any other container of your choosing.

#### 4.1.1. register_UI

The register box contains inputs for user ID (which can be used to link the user with other elements in external databases), e-mail address (which will be used to send confirmation e-mail and reset codes for your password) and for password and password repetition. It tests validity of all inputs and tries to register new account after pushing the "Register" button.

It produces modal dialog detailing the result. Additionally, if registered successfully it sends user a confirmation e-mail.

Currently the functions accept user ID and password consisting of 8~25 alphanumeric characters. It is planned to change in future iterations to widen the requirements - especially for passwords.

Provided password is saved in hashed form - using the `scrypt::hashPassword` function.

#### 4.1.2. login_UI

The login box contains inputs for user ID and password. After pushing the "Login" button, it check validity of inputs and logins user. Produces modal dialog detailing results.

[![Login UI  - click for gif!](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/2_login.png)](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/2_login.gif){target="_blank"}

#### 4.1.3. password_reset_UI

The box for password reset consists of two UI elements: the password_reset_UI `div` element and modal dialog it produces after confirming validity of inputted confirmation code.

The main `div` contains input for User ID. After user inputs their ID, they should push "Send code" button, which generates their 24h-valid resetcode mails it to their e-mail and stores in hashed form in the database.

After they receive reset code, they need to input it in the next inputbox below and push next button. The validity of inputted code in relation to user ID is then checked. If correct, the new modal dialog opens to input the new password.

[![Reset UI  - click for gif!](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/3_reset1.png)](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/3_reset1.gif){target="_blank"}

The user need to provide new password and repeat it to check for any typos. After pushing the "Confirm new password" button, below input boxes a message is rendered to give feedback to the user - if the password was changed successfully. After that, the user can close modal dialog with "OK" button.

[![Reset modal dialog - click for gif!](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/4_reset2.png)](https://statismike.github.io/gallery/shiny.reglog/4_reset2.gif){target="_blank"}

#### 4.1.4. logout_button

Simple `actionButton` for your users to log out during ShinyApp session. Clicking it brings on `modalDialog` asking if they are sure that they want to logout.

### 4.2. Server function

Currently there is only one server function: login_server()

```{r login_server, eval = FALSE}
login_server(
  id = "login_system", 
  db_method = c("gsheet", "sqlite"), 
  mail_method = c("emayili", "gmailr"),
  appname,
  appaddress,
  lang = "en",
  gsheet_file,
  sqlite_db,
  gmailr_user,
  emayili_user,
  emayili_password,
  emayili_host,
  emayili_port
  )
```

#### 4.2.1. Arguments

`login_server` arguments can be divided into three main groups:

##### 4.2.1.1 General arguments: always mandatory

These arguments are always mandatory while using `login_server`

+ *id* argument defaults to "login_system". You can use different name - but remember to keep it consistent for all functions
+ *db_method* specify which database method you want to use. At this moment there are two methods for databases: `gsheet` and `sqlite`
+ *mail_method* specify which e-mailing method you want to use. At this moment there are two methods fo e-mailing: `gmailr` and `emayili`
+ *appname* is the character string with title of your application
+ *appaddress* is the character string with URL address of your application for your users to navigate from their confirmation mail
+ *lang* argument defaults to "en". It changes the language of your modules. Currently only one other option is available: "pl" for Polish

##### 4.2.1.2 Arguments specific to database methods

+ *gsheet_file* is the character string containing your googlesheets ID. Argument is mandatory when using `gsheet` database method
+ *sqlite_db* is the character string specifying path to your sqlite database path. Argument is mandatory when using `sqlite`

##### 4.2.1.3 Arguments specific to e-mail methods

+ *gmailr_user* is the character string of your gmail address that you wish the application to use for automatic e-mails. Used in `gmailr` mailing method

+ *emayili_user* is the character string of your email address, that is also used to log into your mailbox. Used in `emayili` mailing method, as the ones below. 
+ *emayili_password* is the character string of password that you use to log into your mailbox
+ *emayili_host* is the character string specifying the sending host of your mailbox (fe. `smtp.gmail.com` for gmail mailbox)
+ *emayili_port* is the character string containing the sending port of your mailbox (fe. `465` for gmail mailbox)


#### 4.2.2. Values

`login_server` function creates `reactiveValues` object containing three elements, describing the status of current sessions' active user.

+ *is_logged* returns a boolean indicating, if the user is anonymous (`FALSE`) or logged in (`TRUE`)
+ *user_id* returns a character string containing the ID specyfied during registration and used to log-in. When `is_logged = F` it countains the timestamp of time when the anonymous user began his session. It can be used to link specific activities and outputs generated by the same person.
+ *user_mail* returns a character string containing the email address provided during registration. It can be used for automatic sending the user some kind of e-mails (fe. containing the results of some analysis after using your ShinyApp). When `is_logged = F` it contains the empty string value (`""`)

Additionally, it stores the tibbles of `user_db` and `reset_db` content under `session$userData` inside `reactive_db` object of `reactiveValues` class.

```{r active_user example, eval = FALSE}
# save the output in the server function of you application

auth <- login_server(...)

# you can check if currently the user is logged

isTRUE(auth$is_logged)

# moreover, you can check what is the ID and mail of currently logged user

user_data <- list(
  ID = auth$user_id,
  mail = auth$user_mail
)
```
